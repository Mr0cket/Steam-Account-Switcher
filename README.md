# Steam account switcher
A windows Bat file to switch between steam accounts - No GUI.
Automatically switch between 2 steam accounts without needing to retype username & password.

To be introduced:
1. the most basic level of error correcting behaviour.
2. type the username into the CLI (and remember it) rather than editing the bat file directly.
